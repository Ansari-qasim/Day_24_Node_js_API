Angular’s HttpClient and GET request flow (short)
Angular’s HttpClientModule allows the app to make HTTP requests to external APIs or backends.

Import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts so Angular can use HTTP services.

Create a service (e.g., StudentService) and inject HttpClient into it.

Use http.get('<URL>') to send a GET request to the backend. This returns an Observable.

Subscribe to the Observable (in a component like StudentListComponent) to receive the response data.

Display the data in the component template using Angular directives like *ngFor.

Flow:
Angular → HttpClient GET → Backend API (Node.js) → Data from Database → Angular displays it.
